# Security and Hardening

## Overview

Security-first development practices for web applications. Treat every external input as hostile, every secret as sacred, and every authorization check as mandatory. Security isn't a phase — it's a constraint on every line of code that touches user data, authentication, or external systems.

Worked code examples for every pattern in this skill are in `references/examples.md`.

## When to Use

- Building anything that accepts user input
- Implementing authentication or authorization
- Storing or transmitting sensitive data
- Integrating with external APIs or services
- Adding file uploads, webhooks, or callbacks
- Handling payment or PII data

## Process: Threat Model First

Controls bolted on without a threat model are guesses. Before hardening, spend five minutes thinking like an attacker:

1. **Map the trust boundaries.** Where does untrusted data cross into your system? HTTP requests, form fields, file uploads, webhooks, third-party APIs, message queues, and **LLM output**. Every boundary is attack surface.
2. **Name the assets.** What's worth stealing or breaking? Credentials, PII, payment data, admin actions, money movement.
3. **Run STRIDE over each boundary** — a quick lens, not a ceremony:

| Threat | Ask | Typical mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **S**poofing | Can someone impersonate a user/service? | Authentication, signature verification |
| **T**ampering | Can data be altered in transit or at rest? | Integrity checks, parameterized queries, HTTPS |
| **R**epudiation | Can an action be denied later? | Audit logging of security events |
| **I**nformation disclosure | Can data leak? | Encryption, field allowlists, generic errors |
| **D**enial of service | Can it be overwhelmed? | Rate limiting, input size caps, timeouts |
| **E**levation of privilege | Can a user gain rights they shouldn't? | Authorization checks, least privilege |

4. **Write abuse cases next to use cases.** For each feature, ask "how would I misuse this?" — then make that your first test.

If you can't name the trust boundaries for a feature, you're not ready to secure it. This is OWASP **A04: Insecure Design** — most breaches begin in design, not code.

## The Three-Tier Boundary System

### Always Do (No Exceptions)

- **Validate all external input** at the system boundary (API routes, form handlers)
- **Parameterize all database queries** — never concatenate user input into SQL
- **Encode output** to prevent XSS (use framework auto-escaping, don't bypass it)
- **Use HTTPS** for all external communication
- **Hash passwords** with bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 (never store plaintext)
- **Set security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- **Use httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies** for sessions
- **Run `npm audit`** (or equivalent) before every release

### Ask First (Requires Human Approval)

- Adding new authentication flows or changing auth logic
- Storing new categories of sensitive data (PII, payment info)
- Adding new external service integrations
- Changing CORS configuration
- Adding file upload handlers
- Modifying rate limiting or throttling
- Granting elevated permissions or roles

### Never Do

- **Never commit secrets** to version control (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, full credit card numbers)
- **Never trust client-side validation** as a security boundary
- **Never disable security headers** for convenience
- **Never use `eval()` or `innerHTML`** with user-provided data
- **Never store sessions in client-accessible storage** (localStorage for auth tokens)
- **Never expose stack traces** or internal error details to users

## Prevention Patterns (OWASP Top 10)

Each rule below has a worked example in `references/examples.md`.

- **Injection:** Parameterize every query (or use an ORM). Never build SQL, shell commands, or query filters by string concatenation with external input.
- **Broken authentication:** Hash passwords with bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 (salt rounds ≥ 12); store session secrets in the environment; issue httpOnly + secure + sameSite cookies with an expiry.
- **XSS:** Rely on framework auto-escaping; never assign untrusted data to `innerHTML`. If you must render HTML, sanitize with DOMPurify first.
- **Broken access control:** Authentication is not authorization. Every protected endpoint verifies the authenticated user may act on *this specific resource* (ownership or role check), returning 403 otherwise.
- **Security misconfiguration:** Apply security headers via helmet (or equivalent), define a CSP, and restrict CORS to an explicit origin list — never wildcard with credentials.
- **Sensitive data exposure:** Strip secret fields (password hashes, reset tokens) before returning records; load secrets from the environment and fail fast when missing.
- **SSRF:** Any server-side fetch of a user-influenced URL must allowlist scheme + host, resolve DNS and reject private/reserved IPs, and forbid redirects. High-risk surfaces need DNS pinning (the check-then-fetch gap is exploitable via short-TTL rebinding).
- **Input validation:** Validate at the boundary with a schema library (zod or similar) so handlers only ever see typed, validated data; return 422 with structured details on failure.
- **File uploads:** Enforce an allowlist of MIME types and a size cap; don't trust extensions — check magic bytes when it matters.
- **Rate limiting:** Rate-limit the API in general and auth endpoints strictly (an order of magnitude tighter).

## Triaging Dependency Audit Results

Not all audit findings require immediate action:

```
Audit reports a vulnerability
├── Severity: critical or high
│   ├── Reachable in your app? → Fix immediately (update, patch, or replace)
│   ├── Dev-only or unused path? → Fix soon, not a blocker
│   └── No fix available? → Workaround, replace, or allowlist with a review date
├── Severity: moderate
│   ├── Reachable in production? → Fix in the next release cycle
│   └── Dev-only? → Backlog
└── Severity: low → Fix during regular dependency updates
```

**Key questions:** Is the vulnerable function actually called? Runtime or dev-only dependency? Exploitable in your deployment context? When you defer a fix, document the reason and set a review date.

### Supply-Chain Hygiene

`npm audit` catches known CVEs; it won't catch a malicious or typosquatted package. Also:

- **Commit the lockfile** and install with `npm ci` (not `npm install`) in CI — reproducible builds, no silent version drift.
- **Review new dependencies before adding them** — maintenance, download counts, and whether they truly earn their place. Every dependency is attack surface.
- **Be wary of `postinstall` scripts** in unfamiliar packages — they run arbitrary code at install time.
- **Watch for typosquats** — `cross-env` vs `crossenv`, `react-dom` vs `reactdom`.

## Secrets Management

```
.env files:
  ├── .env.example  → Committed (template with placeholder values)
  ├── .env          → NOT committed (contains real secrets)
  └── .env.local    → NOT committed (local overrides)

.gitignore must include: .env, .env.local, .env.*.local, *.pem, *.key
```

**Always check before committing:** `git diff --cached | grep -i "password\|secret\|api_key\|token"`

**If a secret is ever committed, rotate it.** Deleting the line or rewriting history is not enough — assume it's compromised the moment it reaches a remote. Revoke and reissue the key first, then purge it from history.

## Securing AI / LLM Features

If your app calls an LLM — chatbots, summarizers, agents, RAG — it inherits a new attack surface. Map it to the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/):

- **Treat all model output as untrusted input (LLM05).** Never pass LLM output straight into `eval`, SQL, a shell, `innerHTML`, or a file path. Validate and encode it exactly as you would raw user input.
- **Assume prompts can be hijacked (LLM01: Prompt Injection).** Untrusted text in the context window — a user message, a fetched web page, a PDF — can carry instructions. The system prompt is not a security boundary; enforce permissions in code, not in the prompt.
- **Keep secrets and other users' data out of prompts (LLM02 / LLM07).** Anything in the context can be echoed back.
- **Constrain tool and agent permissions (LLM06: Excessive Agency).** Scope tools to the minimum, require confirmation for destructive actions, validate every tool argument.
- **Bound consumption (LLM10).** Cap tokens, request rate, and loop depth so a crafted input can't run up cost or hang the system.
- **Isolate retrieval data (LLM08).** In RAG, treat the vector store as a trust boundary: partition embeddings per tenant, validate documents before indexing.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This is an internal tool, security doesn't matter" | Internal tools get compromised. Attackers target the weakest link. |
| "We'll add security later" | Security retrofitting is 10x harder than building it in. Add it now. |
| "No one would try to exploit this" | Automated scanners will find it. Security by obscurity is not security. |
| "The framework handles security" | Frameworks provide tools, not guarantees. You still need to use them correctly. |
| "It's just a prototype" | Prototypes become production. Security habits from day one. |
| "Threat modeling is overkill here" | Five minutes of "how would I attack this?" prevents the design flaws no control can patch later. |
| "It's just LLM output, it's only text" | That "text" can be a SQL statement, a script tag, or a shell command. Treat it like any untrusted input. |

## Red Flags

- User input passed directly to database queries, shell commands, or HTML rendering
- Secrets in source code or commit history
- API endpoints without authentication or authorization checks
- Missing CORS configuration or wildcard (`*`) origins
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Stack traces or internal errors exposed to users
- Dependencies with known critical vulnerabilities
- Server fetches user-supplied URLs without an allowlist (SSRF)
- LLM/model output passed into a query, the DOM, a shell, or `eval`
- Secrets, PII, or the full system prompt placed inside an LLM context window

## Verification

After implementing security-relevant code:

- [ ] `npm audit` shows no critical or high vulnerabilities
- [ ] No secrets in source code or git history
- [ ] All user input validated at system boundaries
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checked on every protected endpoint
- [ ] Security headers present in response (check with browser DevTools)
- [ ] Error responses don't expose internal details
- [ ] Rate limiting active on auth endpoints
- [ ] Server-side URL fetches validated against an allowlist (no SSRF)
- [ ] LLM/model output validated and encoded before use (if AI features present)
